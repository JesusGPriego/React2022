# React Course 2022

In this course I will be learning React by building an entire e-commerce app, using latest react tools and stripe.

## Monster Rolodex

A simple app that displays cards that shows an image, and some data fetched from an api.

This app has been developed by using component classes, and not functional components, and has been a good introduction to React.

## Dogs Rolodex

It is the same as Monster Rolodex, but showing other design and developed using functional components.

## Crwn Shop

This is the e-commerce project the course is about.

In this course Ill be using:

- Functional components
- Hooks
- routing
- Context API
- styled-components
- firebase integration
- stripe payment
