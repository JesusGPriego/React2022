# React Course 2022

In this course I will be learning React by building an entire e-commerce app, using latest react tools and stripe.

## Monster Rolodex

A simple app that displays cards that shows an image, and some data fetched from an api.

This app has been developed by using component classes, and not functional components, and has been a good introduction to React.
